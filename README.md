# Educapedia Web App

 [Educapedia](https://educapediaa.netlify.app/) is a single page web application for students who want to get the proper guideline about their career.

### What Have I Used?

I have used React JS, React Router and a CSS Framework named Bootstrap. I have used the CDN here and designed it on my own way.

### Web Sections

The web application has few sections like home, about, services. I have maintained responsiveness as much as possible but still there are some bug in responsive part.
